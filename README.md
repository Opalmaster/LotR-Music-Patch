# LotR Music-Patch
I created this patch because the other LotR music patch was bugged and did not cover most zones and most tracks. 
You can hear many different LotR and some Hobbit songs playing in many zones.
Horde taverns are not covered yet (I may add in a future update)
Enjoy!

# HOW TO INSTALL
- Remove or disable other music patches if you have any
- Download patch-m from the Google Drive link
- Rename if the letter m is already taken by another patch (if necessary)
- Put it into your data folder
