# LotR Music Patch
I created this patch from scratch because the only available LotR music patch was bugged and it didn't cover most zones and most tracks.

This patch is very rich. You will hear many different LotR and some LotR related (Hobbit etc.) songs in all cities and many zones.

You can create an issue here if you have suggestions to make. I may update the patch in the future. 

Enjoy!

# HOW TO INSTALL
- Remove or disable other music patches if you have any
- Download patch-m from the Google Drive link
